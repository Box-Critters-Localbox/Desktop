# Desktop

Reopen the dusty box of the world of Box Critters with this app. This repository features all of the perks of [Localbox](https://github.com/Box-Critters-Localbox/Localbox) packaged into an Electron app for ease-of-use, with added Discord RPC support!

## Assets

For information on assets and how to get them, read [here](https://github.com/Box-Critters-Localbox/Localbox?tab=readme-ov-file#assets).

## Server

To build the server, first setup [Localbox](https://github.com/Box-Critters-Localbox/Localbox) and run `deno run build`. Once the server is done building, clone this repository as well. Finally, move the build of the server to the root of this repository and name it "Localbox", if it isn't already named that.

## Building

```
npm run buildwindows
```
